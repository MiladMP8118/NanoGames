# 🎮 NanoGames

**Ultra-small games. Maximum creativity.**

---

## 🧠 What is NanoGames?

**NanoGames** is an experimental playground for building games with one strict rule:

> **The final executable must be smaller than 1 MB.**

Some games go much further —  
for example, a fully playable **C++ game with a 17 KB `.exe`**.

This repository explores how far **creativity, math, and low-level programming** can go under extreme size constraints.

NanoGames focuses on:

- Creativity under constraints  
- Low-level optimization  
- Procedural graphics & audio  

> **Constraints don’t limit creativity — they sharpen it.**

## 🛠️

Each project produces:

- ✅ A **single executable**
- ✅ Final size **< 1 MB**

---

## 📦 Rules

- ✅ Executable size must be **under 1 MB**
- ✅ One game = one `.exe`
- ❌ No installers
- ❌ No large external assets
- ⚠️ External libraries must be minimal and justified

---

## 💡 Game Ideas That Fit Well Under 1MB

- Classic arcade games (Pong, Snake, Breakout)
- Minimal roguelikes
- Puzzle games
- Physics experiments
- Vector or ASCII-based games
